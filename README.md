# Wine-quality-analysis
The dataset is related to the red variant of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. 
For more details, consult the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.). 
These datasets can be viewed as regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Apply Regression and find the quality of Wine.
